<p>This data visualization graphs six different U.S. domestic airlines' performance from 2003-2017. It shows each airlines' yearly average of on-time arrivals. The data was collected from RITA.</p>
<strong>Design:</strong><br>
<strong>Cleaning with R</strong><br>
The data is from <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/ot_delaycause1.asp?display=download&pn=0&month=11&year=2014" target="_blank">RITA</a>, selecting a dataset that included all domestic flights from all carriers to and from major airports from June 2003 through May 2017. Exploratory data analysis was conducted using Rstudio, and is detailed in data.Rmd. While analyzing the data, I assumed that there might be trends in individual airline performance (# arrivals delayed / # total arrivals) over the 14 year period. I decided that a line chart with multiple series would best show these different trends across different airlines.  At beginning, I  produced a passing plot to explore the data:
<img src="Rplot-28-airlines.jpg" width="1195" height="639" alt=""/> 
  <br>

As we can see, this is too busy! There were 28 airlines, and the line chart was messy and ineffective in displaying any distinguishable trends.   <br>
With the context of providing the reader with airlines that would be most relevant to him or her, I shortened that data to feature only the 6 most active airlines, i.e. the 6 airlines with the highest gross number of flights on a monthly basis. I created two plots;   <br>
1)	The re-do of the first line chart with the six top airlines  <br>
2)	Another chart showing total annual flights:  <br>

<img src="Rplot-6-top-airlines.jpg" width="802" height="548" alt=""/> <br>
</br>

My initial evaluation of these charts were that they were satisfactory in visualizing the different trends of these 6 airlines. It shows how various airlines improved or worsened over time, and which airlines were currently performing the best, as of 2017. It also showed the general trends that all 6 airlines experienced: an aggregate dip in performance from 2006 to 2008 and 2013 to 2014, individual peaks from 2013 to 2016, and a more recent drop from 2016 to 2017. <br><br>
I decided to display the performance trends rather than gross number of flights, as I was more interested in the question, "Which airlines are you more likely to be on time with?"<br><br>

<strong><h3>Data Visualization (dimple.js)</h3></strong>

I decided to improve upon the initial data visualization as I implemented it with D3.js and dimple.js in the following ways:<br></br>
1)	Fix scaling in the 'On Time Percentage' axis, particularly setting the maximum at 100% to show what the disparity from the maximum, perfect on-time value.<br><br>

2)	Overlay scatter plot points to emphasize each airline's individual data points at each year.<br><br>

3)	Add transparency, as some areas of the graph (2010-2012) have considerable overlap.<br><br>

I re-evaluated the design decisions that I made during exploratory data analysis, and considered that a line chart was the best way to represent the trends of each airline over time. Coloring each line series was also a good way to visually encode and distinguish airlines from each other. With the adjustment of the y-axis, I also decided to move the legend to the top right, providing close proximity to the more relevant data points near 2017. I was concerned with 'Lie Factor' and truncating the y-axis minimum at a non-zero value; ultimately, I chose to truncate it just below the lowest 'valley', as I was concerned that a 0-100% scale would have crowded the lines and obfuscated any trends.<br><br>
